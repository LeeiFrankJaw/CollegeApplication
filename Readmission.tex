	\section*{Statement:}
	After I left Cornell in the spring of \onum{2012}, I lived in Shanghai for less
	than a month and enjoyed Shanghai Library. While I was exploring more on
	philosophy using the library resources, I got a phone call from a friend of
	mine, who worked in a study abroad service agency in Zhengzhou. He wanted me to
	work in the agency and I accepted. I left the job after two months since I
	found it is not that technology-involved and I could not learn much from it.
	
	In the following years, I lived in several cities in China (Beijing, Tongling,
	Shanghai) and continued to learn using available resources (books, \textsc{mooc}s,
	websites). At the time, I thought I could land a job in IT industry after
	acquiring sufficient knowledge and skills and I spent quite an amount of time
	learning computer science.
	
	% notable books
	I benefited a lot from learning computer organization by reading
	\textcite{COA8e}, who is also one of my favorites computer science textbook
	author. Meanwhile, I learned how to program in C by reading \textcite{K&R}. I became interested in how computer works on a fundamental level and
	spent a lot time with \textcite{LCDF}, which covers the fundamentals of digital
	circuits. It was such a pleasant experience to see how combinatorial and
	sequential logic works. I wanted to know more circuit theory and explored more
	on it. The more I learned, The more I wanted to dig deeper into the fundamental
	level. I believe I cannot understand how computers work without knowing the
	underlying physics (esp.~electromagnetism). However, physics is a hard subject
	to explore on my own and I encountered numerous difficulties without
	instructors.
	
	% Try to learn Violin
	I have been a fan of Bach since long and was deeply moved by his sonatas and
	partitas for solo violin (\textsc{bwv} \onum{1001-1006}). This motivated me to
	learn the violin. In the end of \onum{2013}, I took a course in violin. I
	played the guitar and thought I could transfer the knowledge of guitar to
	violin playing. Even though I have an instructor this time, violin is the
	hardest musical instrument I have encountered. Despite my unsuccessful attempt
	with violin, I really enjoyed the learning experience.
	
	% my MOOCing experience
	Over the years, I successfully finished \onum{21} \textsc{mooc}s from various
	course providers, many of which were accomplished with distinction. Two of them
	are officially verified by Coursera. One was \textcitetitle{LLI2}, the other
	was \textcitetitle{FPPS}. The list of those \onum{21} courses and correspondent
	statements of accomplishment can be found on
	\textit{CourseFinder}~\cite{accredible}.
	
	% Hardware Software Interface / CSAPP
	I want to mention two \textsc{mooc}s specifically here. The first is
	\textcitetitle{HSI} and the other is \textcitetitle{CSV}, being the most rewarding
	\textsc{mooc}s for computer science and mathematics respectively.
	
	\citetitle{HSI} provided some challenging virtual labs through the Fedora (a
	Linux distro) virtual machine. The textbook for this course was the classic
	\textcite{CSAPP}. Understanding how high-level languages are translated
	into the basic instructions of assembly language and how software interacts
	with hardware through those virtual labs was a really wonderful experience.

	\citetitle{CSV}, which did not use any textbook, offered a perspective that was
	very different from most other calculus courses. It was definitely not an
	oversimplified calculus course that only teaches you the mechanics of calculus.
	It was neither an analysis-like calculus course that constructs the real number
	from an axiomatic approach. It offered the right amount of justification of the
	subject as a second course in calculus and tried to unify the entire course
	through Taylor series.
	
	% detail of the story with starworking
	One day in \onum{2014}, it was quite crowded as usual in the Shanghai Library.
	Fortunately, I managed to find a seat. The guy next to me was coding with a
	fancy \textsc{ide} on his MacBook Pro. At the moment, I thought he was just
	another programmer. I was curious about what he was doing and looked at his
	screen to find out. To my surprise, his code was written in Scala, a then rare
	programming language in China. I initiated the talk with him by saying that I
	just completed a related \textsc{mooc}~\cite{FPPS} by the creator of Scala,
	Martin Odersky and really liked some ideas of the functional programming
	paradigm (\textsc{fp}). Possibly due to the rarity of \textsc{fp} in China as
	opposed to object-oriented programming paradigm (\textsc{oop}), he also replied
	with surprise that he agreed but was more interested in making real-world
	application than just theory. He told me that already made an office automation
	web app with the language for his company and kept improving it. We then talked
	about some other computer-related stuff. Some time later, he revealed that he
	owned the company mentioned earlier and asked me whether I was interested in
	having an internship in his company. I did not accept right away since I wanted
	to focus on learning new things at the time, but we exchanged our contact info.
	
	However, some months later, I wanted to examine what I had learned and the best way to do it was through real work experience. I contacted the aftermentioned man to see if I was still able to intern at his company and he accepted.
	The This story was covered by \textcitejournal{GT}.

	Last summer, I taught myself \LaTeX\ and became a frequent user. I almost
	abandoned Microsoft Word completely since then and used \LaTeX\ whenever I found
	suitable. In fact, this file was typeset in \LuaLaTeX\ and source code can be
	found on \textit{GitHub}~\cite{Readmission}. I am able to typeset formulae like
	\begin{align*}
	\dd x \int_{t=\sin x}^{\tan x} e^{-t^2} \dt
		&= \dd x \paren{\int_{t=0}^{\tan x} e^{-t^2} \dt -
			\int_{t=0}^{\sin x} e^{-t^2} \dt} \\
		&= \dd x \int_{t=0}^{\tan x} e^{-t^2} \dt
			- \dd x \int_{t=0}^{\sin x} e^{-t^2} \dt \\
		&= e^{-\tan^2 x} \cdot \sec^2 x - e^{-\sin^2 x} \cdot \cos x.
	\end{align*}
	With the \TikZ\ package, I could make graphics like the figure on the right.

	I did not find the same theoretical depth I found in mathematics.

	\section*{Intended Major and Career Plan:}
	I intend to double major in mathematics and physics. I still love computer
	science and there is a lot more to learn in the field. But with the double
	major, I do not know if I have enough time and effort for it. In addition,
	there are general requirements to meet.
	
	If possible, I want to skip some lower division courses in mathematics and
	computer science like \textsc{mat} \onum{122}, \textsc{mat} \onum{221},
	\textsc{csc} \onum{140}, \textsc{csc} \onum{151}. Due to my strong interest in
	mathematics, I will definitely have a wonderful time with mathematics. Since I
	do not have much background in physics, I will probably have a very hard time
	with it. But I like challenges; hard courses just turn me on and easy courses
	are time-wasters.
	
	I want to stay in the academia and become an academic (if not a mathematician).
	This means I will seek master and doctoral degrees after graduation from
	Cornell.
	
	\section*{Term I wish to return:}
	I wish to return on the block \onum{1} of the \onum{2016-2017} academic year.
	
	\section*{Housing Preference:}
	I do not have any particular housing preference, except that I want to make the
	habit of going to bed early.
